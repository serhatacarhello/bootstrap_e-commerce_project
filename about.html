            <p>
              We are individual producers with deep ties to this ancient land.
              While we haven't yet grown into a corporate structure, that dream
              remains on our horizon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The miracle of nature—soil, sun, air—has blessed our journey from
              the very beginning. Right here, in the ancient lands of the
              Lycians, our ancestors traveled from Central Asia, following goats
              on horseback with loads carried by camels until they reached these
              shores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the coastline was nearby, they chose the mountains for
              their coolness. The goats loved the mountains, and though a nomad
              once taught a goat to swim to the islands (as I once saw
              documented), our ways remained tied to the highlands.

            <p>
              In the old days, a single bottle of oil would last an entire
              summer. Why? Because people had goats that provided yogurt,
              cheese, and butter—with these staples, a bottle of oil was plenty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, as a new generation of nomadic descendants, we're bridging
              traditional and modern approaches—growing olives as organically as
              possible and processing them with modern methods to bring them to
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The costs are high and market prices are low, so we ask for your
              support. We strive to take freshly harvested olives to the factory
              immediately, though sometimes they might wait until the second
              day.

                <p>
                  Daily oil extraction is important because olives begin to
                  "heat up" when they wait, increasing their acidity. We harvest
                  daily to ensure the freshest oil possible.

                <p>
                  At the factory, the olive paste is brought to around 40
                  degrees Celsius (body temperature) before separating the oil,
                  preserving its natural qualities and nutritional value.
